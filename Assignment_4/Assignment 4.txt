1. When we want to implement a functionality that works for multiple types with the same logic, we will have to use overload to adjust for each of the types and that is
   both messy and tedious. Instead, we can use generic classes or methods to create the functionality for multiple types all at once.

2. We can use the code 
   List<string> str = new List<string>();

3. There are two generic type parameters, where the first one is for key annd the second one is for value.

4. False

5. We can use the method Add() to add items to a list.

6. Remove() and Clear().

7. We can declare the class using the code
   AccessLevel class OurClass<T>

8. False	9. True		10. True
